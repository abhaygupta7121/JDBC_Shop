# Shop Project

## Overview
This project is a Java web application named "Shop". It is built using Maven and includes dependencies for connecting to a PostgreSQL database. The project structure and configurations are managed using standard Maven and IDE-specific files.

## Project Structure
- `.classpath`: This file is used by IDEs like Eclipse to manage the classpath of the project. It lists the locations of the classes and libraries used by the project.
- `.project`: This file is used by IDEs like Eclipse to store project-specific settings and metadata.
- `pom.xml`: This is the Project Object Model file used by Maven. It contains information about the project, its dependencies, and build configuration.

## File Descriptions

### .classpath
The `.classpath` file is essential for Eclipse IDE to understand where to find the source files, libraries, and other dependencies needed to build and run the project.

### .project
The `.project` file is used by Eclipse IDE to store project-specific metadata. This includes the project name and nature (e.g., Java project).

### pom.xml
The `pom.xml` file is crucial for managing the build process with Maven. It defines the project's group ID, artifact ID, version, and dependencies. Below is a snippet of the `pom.xml`:

```xml
